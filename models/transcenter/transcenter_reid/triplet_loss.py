# CAUTION !! #

# At the moment both batch_all and batch_hard seem to pass the error testing from the source
# mentioned above, but in practice for my experiments batch_hard converged to margin and
# batch_all the error exploded. So for me both are not functional at the moment, but
# _get_triplet_mask can be used to get all valid triplets and then F.triplet_margin_loss()
# can be used to get them running. See resnet.py for how the losses are implemented in this
# project.
